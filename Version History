 Version History
 1.0.0: Initial Release on 02/07/2019.
 1.0.1: Released on 03/07/2019. 
   *Fixed a typo I noticed in one of the strings.
   *Removed two unnecessary operations I did in the Audio module.
 1.0.2: Released on 03/07/2019
   *Readded the "unncecessary" operations, and fixed an issue they had
    in initial version.
 1.0.3: Released on 04/07/2019
   *Fixed new possible issues with the Audio module.
   *Fixed an issue where clearing the required number of lines sometimes 
    would not increase the hardship level.
 1.0.4: Released on 04/07/2019
   *Now disposing properly a lot of graphical objects, which it wasn't
    previously. Found about it while using Mithran's debugger script.
 1.0.5: Released on 07/07/2019
   *Performance update. In previous version, all stats (level, deleted lines,
    scores, etc) were redrawn whenever one of them changes, causing some lag.
    Now, it redraws only the part that needs to be redrawn, as it should be.
    Did other improvements too.
 1.0.6 Released on 07/07/2019
   *Cleared one visual bug, that came with 1.0.5, and failed to detect it
    initially.
 1.0.7 Released on 09/07/2019
   *Fixed small visual bug.
   *Removed my edit on the Audio module, as I found out the engine
    have methods that do (and do it better) what my edit of the module
    was set to do.
 1.0.8 Released on 10/07/2019
   *Now, when loading older save file, the Tetris script will asume initial
    values for contents that are otherwise extracted from the save file.
   *Now properly initializing Tetris data upon starting new game, which it
    wasn't previously.
   *Improved the action counter, so it counts only successful actions.
   *Other small bug fixes.
   *Some code optimisation.
 1.1.0 Released on 16/07/2019
   *New Option in the "General Options": Make your own tetromino spawning bags!
   *Improved a bit the code about text positioning in "Window Block 1", so
    changing font or block sizes would not ruin it.
   *Small code optimisations.
 1.1.1 Released on 21/07/2019
   *Now the field is one single sprite, and the building blocks are its
    rectangles. In previous versions each building block had its own sprite.
    That doesn't change the Tetris appearance.
   *Did more code optimisations.  
 1.1.2 Released on 22/07/2019
   *Fixed a method, that was set to work with previous version objects,
    that would lead to game crash upon starting new game after game over.
 1.2.0 Released on 07/08/2019
   *Added option for setting max level.
   *Every window now have padding option
   *Option to set respawn speed and row deletion speed.
    In previous versions those two were one settings entry, executed by
    messy code.
   *Reorginized and reworked code, so now is more readible, and hopefully,
    more effective.
   *Renamed the menu button for playing Tetris, so it does not use the
    word "Tetris".
 1.3.0 Released on 10/08/2019
   *New feature: Highligh deletion row. Comes with extra settings for it,
    including new color entry in the COLORS.
   *Added option that BGM and BGS position from normal RPG game not to be 
    restored, so tracks would replay from begining. By default, now they won't
    recover position, but can be changed.
   *Added option to modify the clearing rectangle (to add or substract to
    original values), so there are not uncleaned pixels on stats change.
    Stats are the level, actions, scores, etc. On default font no need to
    modify, but you might need if you set different fonts.
   *Fixed bug that came with version 1.2.0: crash client when trying to rotate
    too close to obstacle. 
   *Fixed bug, which would draw next Tetromino on resume, doing that each time
    the player resumes the game. Bug came with version 1.2.0.
   *Cleared bug, which would lead to crash if developer decides not to include 
    background picture. Bug came with version 1.2.0 too.
   *Small optimisations of the code. 
 1.3.1 Released on 13/12/2020
   *Now saved background sound should be restored too, after done
    with tetris game.
